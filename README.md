# configs
This repository contains various configuration files and scripts.

## Install script
There is an installation script that copies config files to dedicated locations.
```bash
./install.sh all
```
applies all configurations while e.g.
```bash
./install.sh nvim
```
sets just `nvim` config (see `./install.sh -h` for all the options).
